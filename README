== MMS Prompter
Quick, dirty and unfinished (yet working :-) ) script that helps in finding a
word for a given number according to mnemonic major system.
==  What it currently can do:
    
* Generate a file with all aspell words for given language (basic or
  extended)
* Search any file for a pattern. Pattern is a pre-parsed (according
  to keywords, exceptions and other settings) regular expression, so its
  capabilities are quite powerfull and rather easy to use.
